# ITGProject1&2 in the same application.

Project 1 aims in interacting with an s3 bucket using AWS SDK to interact with Spring Boot Framework
This project includes an s3 bucket made at Amazon Console, AWS SDK has been imported into the application to make interact with what Iâ€™ve
made in Amazon Console for my code, the code has HTML pages with inner CSS
styles, the s3 bucket has many photos that I need to reveal the photos in the HTML page, 
I've created an access key and a secret key from Amazon Console to create access to my
spring boot project, then a bucket policy has been created to make the required access from code to s3
bucket with the functions I've created in the project to fetch the required photos from the s3 bucket to an HTML page.

Project 2 aims in interacting with RDS with the project and uploading the server logs (every action) into a new S3 bucket.

Finally, a (.war) file for the project has been created and deployed to an EC2 with custom installations such as Apache Tomcat.
